\arguments{
\item{tree}{list of vectors of equal lengths (\code{n}), specifying the \code{n} vertices (halos) a tree. These vectors are:

\code{descendant} (mandatory) specifies a descendant index for each vertex. This vector must contain one zero, which specifies the root vertex. All other values must be positive integers.

\code{mass} (optional) specifies contains the masses of the vertices. If not given, the mass will be chosen equal to the number of leaves in the subtree leading to this node.

\code{value} (optional) contains values, normalized to [0,1], to be displayed in colour.

\code{length} (optional) number of vertical steps ("snapshots") to the descendant of each vertex. If not given, the default values is one.}

\item{normalize.mass}{logical flag specifying whether the masses should be normalized to the root mass}

\item{sort}{logical flag, specifying if the branches are ordered such that higher mass branches are more central}

\item{spacetype}{integer, specifying how much horizontal space is allocated to each progenitor branch: 1=all progenitors get equal space, 2=proportional to number of leaves, 3=proportional to mass}

\item{straightening}{real between 0 and 1 specifying the maximal mass-ratio up to which it is enforced that the  main progenitor is strictly vertically above its descendant.}

\item{simplify}{logical flag. If TRUE, all the vertices, other than the root, with only one progenitor are removed for graphical simplicity.}

\item{style}{integer value to specify the rendering: 1=straight lines, 2=splines, 3=polygon splines with optimal vertex-matching}

\item{circle.height}{real between 0 and 1 specifying the relative vertical height of circles drawn at the nodes (only with style=3)}

\item{root.length}{length of the root branch, extending down from the root halo}

\item{leaf.length}{length of the leaf branches, extending up from the leaves}

\item{margin}{thickness of margin surrounding the plot}

\item{col}{colour of the edges; or a vector of colours if values have been specified in the tree}

\item{draw.edges}{logical flag to turn on/off edges}

\item{draw.vertices}{logical flag to turn on/off vertices}

\item{draw.box}{logical flag to turn on/off a black frame around the box}

\item{add}{logical flag specifying whether the plot should be added to an existing plot}

\item{xlim}{horizontal range of the tree with margin (only needed if add = TRUE)}

\item{ylim}{vertical range of the tree with margin (only needed if add = TRUE)}

\item{scale}{scaling factor to convert masses into line widths}

\item{gamma}{scaling exponent to convert masses into line widths}

\item{min}{minimum linewidth}

\item{vertex.size}{scaling factor of the vertex size}

\item{pdf.filename}{optional file name of a PDF file to be saved}

\item{pdf.size}{optional size of the PDF image}

\item{forced.x}{optional vector allowing the user to enforce the x-positions of individual nodes. Use NAs for automatic values.}

\item{forced.y}{optional vector allowing the user to enforce the y-positions of individual nodes. Use NAs for automatic values.}

\item{overlap}{optional number specifying a small vertical overlap between branches to avoid spurious gaps in graphical outputs}
